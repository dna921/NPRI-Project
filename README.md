The **National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) Project** focuses on analyzing the impact of Canada’s federal carbon pricing system, introduced in 2019, on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) from fossil fuels. This project utilizes data from 2000-2022, aiming to evaluate whether emissions declined post-2019, correlate emission reductions with carbon pricing tiers, and predict future trends. The workflow consisted of several key phases, detailed as follows:

#### **1. Data Exploration and Cleaning**
- Segregated the dataset into relevant sections: releases, disposals, transfers, and comments.
- Addressed missing and irrelevant values, removing contextual outliers that could skew analysis.
- Sorted and structured data for cleaner analysis, creating separate datasets for nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions.
- Converted categorical and numerical data into usable formats for machine learning.
- 
#### **2. Data Analysis**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in emissions over time.
- Focused on emissions trends post-2019 to determine the impact of the carbon pricing system.
- Highlighted the relationship between carbon pricing tiers (low, medium, high) and reductions in emissions levels.
- Created visualizations to showcase trends in nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions, including bar plots, line graphs, and correlation heatmaps.

#### **3. Machine Learning Modeling**
- Framed the problem as a classification task to analyze whether emissions reduced post-2019.
- Designed a "Carbon Price-Linked Emission Level Classification" model to classify emissions records based on carbon pricing tiers.
- Trained machine learning models on emissions data and assessed their performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Predicted future emission trends as carbon pricing increases gradually from 2023 to 2030.

#### **4. Presentation of Findings**
- Selected key nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emission trends for the final presentation.
- Used visuals to simplify the interpretation of results and highlight key insights.

#### **Key Outcomes**
- Identified a clear correlation between higher carbon pricing and reduced emissions.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the federal carbon pricing system in curbing emissions.
- Offered predictive insights into future emission levels, supporting long-term policy and environmental planning.

#### **Significance**
The NPRI project highlights the impact of Canada’s carbon pricing system, providing data-driven evidence to inform policy decisions. By analyzing historical emissions data, predicting future trends, and presenting findings with actionable insights, the project underscores the role of carbon pricing in addressing climate change.
